Port of the Brian neural network simulator for Android

Importing project to Android Studio
-----------------------------------

1. Clone the repository to a local directory.
2. Create a libs directory under the repository directory and add the support-v4 library.
    - Find and copy the android-support-v4.jar to the libs/ directory.
    - The default location of this jar, if you used the Android SDK manager, should be: \<android-sdk root\>/extras/android/support/v4/android-support-v4.jar
3. Open Android Studio and open the Import Project dialog (File -> Import Project) or select the Import Project option from the Welcome screen.
4. Select the root of the cloned repository.
5. Default settings on the subsequent dialogs should require no change.


Usage
-----

BrianDROID offers a generic template which is used by brian2's code generation to create a working Android app for running a specific simulation.
The current state of the code generator requires some code to be pasted and edited manually to work.

Detailed instructions for a working example coming soon ...
